# Formula1-social-network
In Formula One, victory is shaped by team dynamics, driver skill, and strategy. Our group explores these elements using data from 1950 to 2023, employing social network analysis to reveal key success factors and relationships within the racing community. Our study aims to uncover what drives success in F1.
